# CAD Sniper MT5 Expert Advisor

## Description
CAD Sniper MT5 is an Expert Advisor designed to maximize trading success in the Forex market. It is based on the CAD Sniper MT5 software. This EA utilizes various input parameters and functions to identify trade signals, calculate trade volume based on risk factors, and place orders accordingly.

## Input Parameters
- **RiskFactor1**: Risk factor 1 (minimum drawdown)
- **RiskFactor2**: Risk factor 2
- **RiskFactor3**: Risk factor 3
- **RiskFactor4**: Risk factor 4
- **RiskFactor5**: Risk factor 5

## Initialization Function (OnInit)
The OnInit function is responsible for initializing the Expert Advisor. It first initializes the CAD Sniper MT5 software by calling the CADSniperMT5_Init function. If the initialization fails, it prints an error message and returns INIT_FAILED. It then sets a fixed stop-loss for all orders using the SetStopLoss function. The Christmas Filter feature is also set based on whether it is the Christmas season or not.

## Tick Function (OnTick)
The OnTick function is called on each tick of the market. It checks for available trades using the CADSniperMT5_HasSignals function. If there are available trades, it retrieves the available currency pairs using the CADSniperMT5_GetCurrencyPairs function. It then iterates through each currency pair and checks if it is a supported currency pair using the IsSupportedCurrencyPair function. If it is supported, it retrieves the trade signal for the currency pair using the CADSniperMT5_GetTradeSignal function. It then calculates the trade volume based on the risk factor using the CalculateTradeVolume function. Finally, it places an order with the calculated trade volume using the PlaceOrder function.
